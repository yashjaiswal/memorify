Repository for the "Memorify" game I created using Codepen.io

Description:
"Memorify" is a simple game built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The game is developed using codepen.io and hosted on the same platform.

Pre-requisites:
1. The game can be played on any browser that supports ES6(Javascript ECMA6). This includes Google Chrome, Firefox and Chromium Edge.
2. One can directly play the game using https://codepen.io/yashjaiswal/details/vYGgxZR
3. If the URL is not accessible, you can download index.html, index.css and index.js to your local machine. Use the respective CSS and JS files for your HTML page and run the
HTML from any browser that supports ECMA6

How to run the game:
"Memorify" can be directly accessed using the codepen URL: https://codepen.io/yashjaiswal/details/vYGgxZR
Follow the instructions on the screen to play the game.

Rules:
1. Every cell appearing on the grid has an alphabet hidden behind it. Click the cells to open the alphabets. At any given time, you can open a maximum of two cells.
2. When a cell opens, it turns orange.
3. If the two cells match, they turn green and you got one pair right. Likewise, there are 8 pairs of alphabets and you have to match all to win the game.
4. If the pairs don't match, both the cells close and turn white. The game ends when all the pairs are found. It's that simple! 

Happy gaming!
